### Notes

* This tool is meant for users to make shops to share their items.  
As of right now, there is no features present that let you set the price for the items.

* The tool uses a template almost identical to [the one IHazBagels made and shared on the ILoveBacons community forums](http://ilovebacons.com/threads/shop-template-for-mall-shops.10988/).
